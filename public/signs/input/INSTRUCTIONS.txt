UPLOAD YOUR ROAD SIGN IMAGES HERE
=================================

This folder is for uploading your road sign images.

HOW TO USE:
1. Copy your road sign images into this folder
2. You can name them anything you want (e.g., "stop sign.jpg", "yield.png")
3. Run the processing script: node scripts/process-sign-images.js
4. Or use the web interface at: http://localhost:3000/admin/upload-signs

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- PNG (recommended)
- JPG/JPEG
- GIF
- WEBP

SMART DETECTION:
The system will automatically detect what type of sign it is based on:
- Filename keywords (e.g., "stop", "yield", "speed limit")
- Image content analysis
- Common sign patterns

EXAMPLES OF GOOD FILENAMES:
- "stop sign.jpg" → will become "stop-sign.jpg"
- "yield.png" → will become "yield-sign.png"
- "speed limit 80.jpg" → will become "speed-limit.jpg"
- "no left turn.png" → will become "no-left-turn.jpg"

The system will:
✅ Automatically rename files to correct format
✅ Place them in the right category folder
✅ Update the road signs module instantly
✅ Replace generated visuals with your images

Just drop your images here and run the script!
